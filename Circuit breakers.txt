Circuit breakers:

    1) ==> Closed (normal state)
        - request flows normally 
        - failure detected  

    2) ==> open (failure detected)
        - too many failures/timeout
        - calls immediately block temporary

    3) ==> half-open (test state)
        - after cooldown
        - allow limited request
        - if
             success ==> Circuit breakers closes again
             fail ==> Circuit breakers opens again

        
Advantage:
    Enable graceful degradation
        def: design a software in such a way that it continues functioning at a low performance rather than completely shuts the system down
            e.g. : 
                in streaming services/application, when internet bandwidth is low, the service reduce the quality instead of pausing the entire stream
