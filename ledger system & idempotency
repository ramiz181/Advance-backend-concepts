ledger 
    register (database in case of bank transaction system) where we maintain the record/history of every single transaction
        e.g 100 debit --- 200 credit

in bank systems - balance is not hard coded or calculate directly, it always calculates from ledger entries


Ledger entries:

Account	    Type	    Amount
A	        Debit	    -100
B	        Credit	    +100
