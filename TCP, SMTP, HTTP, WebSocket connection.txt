Protocols itself defines:
    - how data is formatted, transmitted
    - who send what and when


TCP is the transport layer for all these protocols


SMTP, HTTP, WebSocekts runs on top of TCP

TCP provides:
    - ordered delivery
    - guaranteed delivery
    - flow control
    - connection persistency (for WebSocekts)


HTTP:
    HTTP defines the rules of communication between browser and server (requests, responses, headers).


SMTP provides:
    1. Message Submission
            => Your app → Mail server
            => (Example: Node.js → Gmail SMTP)

    2. Server-to-Server Email Transfer
