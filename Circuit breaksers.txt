Circuit breakers:

    1) ==> Closed (normal state)
        - request flows normally 
        - failure detectd  

    2) ==> open (failure detected)
        - too many failures/timeout
        - calls immediately block temporary

    3) ==> half-open (test state)
        - after cooldown
        - allow limited request
        - if
             success ==> Circuit breakers closes again
             failes ==> Circuit breakers opens again
