ledger 
    register (database in case of bank transaction system) where we maintain the record/history of every single transaction
        e.g 100 debit --- 200 credit
    
    in banking - ledger systems are immutable, auditable 

in bank systems - balance is not hard coded or calculate directly, it always calculates from ledger entries


Ledger entries:
Transfer $100 from A to B
Account	    Type	    Amount
A	        Debit	    -100
B	        Credit	    +100

Idempotency:
    doing the same operation multiple times will just give you the same/single result
    e.g sent $100 to someone and clicking on 'transfer' button multiple times due to network lose will not create mutiple transaction....

Idempotency key:
    it is a unique for every transaction - to identify the transaction request either its the same transaction or different
